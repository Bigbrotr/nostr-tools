    private_key, public_key = generate_keypair()
    
    # Create event
    event_data = generate_event(
        private_key=private_key,
        public_key=public_key,
        kind=1,
        content="Hello Nostr! 👋"
    )
    event = Event.from_dict(event_data)
    
    # Connect and publish
    relay = Relay("wss://relay.damus.io")
    client = Client(relay, timeout=10)
    
    async with client:
        await client.publish(event)
        print("Event published successfully!")

asyncio.run(main())
